Here is an example of AI interpreting a graph of network-throughput for a server.

PROMPT:

Examine the attached graph. 
A “Healthy” value for the Y-axis is a daily value of “33.0 Tb” or lower. 
A “Critical” value for the Y-axis is a reading of “33.0 Tb” or higher. 
The X-axis plots the “Network Bandwidth” in daily increments. 
Identify the closest day where the value exceeds the critical threshold.


The example graph to examine is found here:

RESPONSE:

To identify the closest day where the value exceeds the critical threshold of 33.0 Tb on the graph:

5/26: The bandwidth is below 32.5 Tb.
5/27: The bandwidth is still below 33.0 Tb.
5/28: The bandwidth reaches and slightly exceeds 33.0 Tb for the first time.
5/29: The bandwidth continues to exceed 33.0 Tb.
5/30: The bandwidth remains above 33.0 Tb.
5/31: The bandwidth is significantly above 33.0 Tb.
The closest day where the value first exceeds the critical threshold of 33.0 Tb is 5/28.

VALIDATION: CORRECT
